            <p>My name is Feven B. Mulugeta. I was born and raised in Ethiopia, I am married and we have a one year old beautifull baby girl, who keeps me busy. I love to help people

            <p>I was happy to find NSS, since it is a great opportunity to become what I always wanted to be. I love the fact that the program is more practice oriented. </p>

            <p> This dinosaur is called Apatosaurus, it lived approximately 150 million years ago during the Jurassic Period. It is amazing how big this dinosaur is. While it was alive, Apatosaurus was gigantic. It was about 90 feet long, about 15 feet tall at the hips and weighed approximately
                 38 tons. Thankfully, this animal was a herbivore, which means that it diet consisted of mainly leaves and other plant material.</p>
                <p> The other amazing thing about this dinosaur is how it digest it's food, It had chisel like teeth that could
                  quickly remove the leaves from branches, but it didnâ€™t chew up the plant material with its teeth. No, scientists
                 now believe that these animals swallowed stones to help them grind up plant material in their stomachs. Rocks used in this way are 
                 called gizzard stones or gastrolithes.</p>
